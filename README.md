This is the repository for my small static web projects.  At the root domain you will find a simple web ui to navigating to the various projects, much like a portal.

I previously had been using a Raspberry Pi to host my own web server, however I have new interests for it... well, that and a certain cat keeps rummaging around behind the couch disconnecting it from my router.   I believe this will be a long term solution for hosting my smaller projects.  Larger, more dynamic, projects that utilize larger storage or applications will remain on a different hosting source.
