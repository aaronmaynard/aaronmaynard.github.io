    <p>For most, exile is a punishment. For Max, it’s an inconvenience. Once a respected (and exceptionally lazy) demon, Max was cast out of Hell and sentenced to a millennium on Earth—stuck in the form of a black cat. Since then, he’s wandered through history, stirring up trouble, making enemies (and the occasional friend), and generally being a thorn in humanity’s side.</p>

    <p>From medieval courts to modern cities, Max has left his mark on history in ways most will never realize. Maybe he whispered a bad idea into a king’s ear, sparked a war with an unfortunate prank, or just sat back and watched as humans fumbled through their own chaos. These are his stories.</p>
