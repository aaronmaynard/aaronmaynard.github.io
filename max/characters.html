        <h3>Emotion Sheet</h3>
        <p><strong>Neutral:</strong> Max sits calmly, his amber eyes narrowed slightly as he surveys his surroundings. His ears are perked forward, listening intently.</p>
        <p><strong>Angry:</strong> Max's fur is raised, and his eyes are narrowed to slits. His tail is swishing back and forth, and he looks ready to pounce.</p>
        <p><strong>Sleepy:</strong> Max often zones out wherever he sits, escpecially when caught in the warmth of the sun. His eyes are half-closed, and his whiskers twitch slightly in his sleep.</p>
        <p><strong>Grin:</strong> Max sits with his mouth open in a wide grin, revealing his sharp teeth. His eyes are narrowed and sparkling with mischief. He looks playful and ready to pounce on a toy... not that he'd ever have one.</p>

        <h3>Action Sheet</h3>
        <p><strong>Leaping:</strong> With his body fully extended and a determined gaze in his amber eyes, Max is captured mid-leap, showcasing his agility and power as he propels himself forward.</p>
        <p><strong>Pawing:</strong> Seated upright, Max raises a paw, his obsidian claws slightly extended, as if swatting playfully at a passing object or demanding attention with a sharp but controlled gesture.</p>
        <p><strong>Plotting:</strong> Crouched low to the ground with narrowed amber eyes and a focused expression, Max appears to be stalking or carefully observing something, his posture conveying a sense of anticipation and strategic intent.</p>
        <p><strong>Playful teasing:</strong> Lying on his back with his paws raised in the air, Max displays a more relaxed and playful side, perhaps inviting interaction or engaging in a bout of feline acrobatics.</p>
